# Lab 5 : (INTERFACING A SEVEN-SEGMENT DISPLAY TO THE PIC18F4321 USING PIC18F ASSEMBLY AND PROGRAMMED I\O)

## Instructions that I followed for this lab :
I wrote assembly code and C code to display the hexadecimal digits on a seven-segment display (common anode) based on a number entered by 4 DIP switches.

## Note
I have written this code using [MPLAB X IDE v5.40](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide)
