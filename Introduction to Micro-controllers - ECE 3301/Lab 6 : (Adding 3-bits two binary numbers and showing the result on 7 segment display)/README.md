# Lab 6 : (Adding 3-bits two binary numbers and showing the result on 7 segment display)

## Instructions that I followed for this lab :
I designed and implemented hardware and software (assembly and C-program) for adding
two 3-bit numbers entered via DIP Switches and display the result (0-E) on
a Seven-Segment Display (common anode).

## Note
I have written this code using [MPLAB X IDE v5.40](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide)
