# Lab 3 : (Writing Main Program and Subroutine in PIC18F Assembly Language)

## Instructions that I followed for this lab :
Used FSR1 to point to the Xi.\
Filled the subroutine sum8 with assembly code to perform Z = âˆ‘ i=1 i=8 (Xi).\
In the main program, I performed Z/8 after calling sum8.\

## Note
I have written this code using [MPLAB X IDE v5.40](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide)
