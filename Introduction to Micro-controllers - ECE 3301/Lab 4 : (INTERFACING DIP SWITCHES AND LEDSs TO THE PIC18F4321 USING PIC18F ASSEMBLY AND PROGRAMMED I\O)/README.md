# Lab 4 : (INTERFACING DIP SWITCHES AND LEDSs TO THE PIC18F4321 USING PIC18F ASSEMBLY AND PROGRAMMED I\O)

## Instructions that I followed for this lab :
I wrote assembly code and C code to control 2 LEDs using 2 DIP switches by following these specifications:\
-If the input at bit 1 of port C is HIGH and the input at bit 1 of port D
is LOW, the LED at port C will be OFF and the LED at port D will be
ON.\
-If the input at bit 1 of port C is LOW and the input at bit 1 of port D is
HIGH, the LED at port C will be ON and the LED at port D will be OFF.\
-If the inputs of both ports C and D are HIGH, both LEDs of ports C
and D will be OFF.\
 -If the inputs of both ports C and D are LOW, both LEDs of ports C
and D will be ON.

## Note
I have written this code using [MPLAB X IDE v5.40](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide)
