# Midterm Exam 1 : (Showing different patterns on 7 Seg Disp using 2 switches)

## Instructions that I followed for this lab :
The 7segment display should be connected to `PORTA`. (segment `a` should be connected to `RA6`, segment `b` should be connected to `RA5`...etc).\
The dip switches should be connected to `PORTD`. Specifically `RD0` and `RD1`.\
* Pattern:\
  `0`: Display is off.\
  `1`: Display toggles the negative sign (segment `g`).\
  `2`: Rotate 2 perimeter segments clockwise.\
  `3`: Rotate 2 perimeter segments counterclockwise.\
* The delays should be fixed at 500 ms (or 0.5 seconds)

## Note
I have written this code using [MPLAB X IDE v5.40](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide)
