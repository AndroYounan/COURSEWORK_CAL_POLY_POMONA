# Project 1: Survey Of The States Population in 2010

In this project, I was given the population of each state of the 50 states in US in 2010, and I was asked to:\
1- Create a structure which contains the state name and the population for year 2010.\
2- Create a dynamic array where each element is an object of the structure defined above.\
3- Calculate and print out the mean of statesâ€™ population for year 2010.\
4- Calculate and print out the median and the state name if applicable.\
5- Calculate and print out the variance and standard deviation. 

## Instructions for this project :

I was asked to use a Dynamic Array and a sorting algorithm in my code.
