# Lab 1: Multiplexer(Mux) 2x1

A multiplexer is a combinational circuit which is used to switch and select between multiple inputs to have the selected one as the output.\
The simplest form of the multiplexer is the 2x1 multiplexer which has two inputs and one output.\
In this example we have two inputs; A and B. Each of them is 4-bits.\
In this assignment, I use Verilog to model and implement the functionality of a 2x1 multiplexer.\
Also, I have applied the code into FPGA [Nexys A7 100T](https://store.digilentinc.com/nexys-a7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-ece-curriculum/)
